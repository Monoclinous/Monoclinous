## About Me

Hello, I'm Quentin. I am an IT student with a passion for creating. I have experience in retail but I currently tinker with servers, operating systems, and basic electronics. I enjoy working on projects in and out of class and continuously expanding my knowledge in the related fields of IT.

Here are a few things that describe me:

- Detail-oriented and dedicated
- Strong problem-solving skills
- Effective communicator
- Team player
- Constantly eager to learn and grow

I am excited to showcase my projects and skills and to connect with like-minded individuals. Feel free to reach out to me via [email/website/social media] for any collaboration or opportunities.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
